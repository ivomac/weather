# Weather CLI using OpenWeatherMap

Gets weather predictions for the next week from OpenWeatherMap for a given city and prints them in a table. If no city is provided, it estimates current location from IP instead. Requires OWM API key on `OWM_API_KEY` environment variable.

Run as ``weather [city[,country-code]]``:

![weather](https://github.com/ivomac/weather/assets/45886067/fa27eb46-ecfb-4053-8179-71cb44e52fdf)

The emoji characters are well aligned for the ttf-symbola font. If you use another font you might have to adjust their width by adding/removing spaces in the mapping table for a good table alignment.
